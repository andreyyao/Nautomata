# Nautomata

Nominal automata, based on [NLambda](https://github.com/szynwelski/nlambda).

# Install

Make sure you have __Cabal__ installed. I recommend installing `ghcup` using your package manager, and then use that to install the "recommended" versions of `cabal` and `ghc`.

To install and build __Nautomata__, simply clone the repository. Then `cd` into the directory and then run `cabal build`. __Cabal__ should automatically take care of downloading __NLambda__ from GitHub and building it.

To run the program, do `cabal run`.
